Description: 

	The Chord Tools project shows the triads in each key
signature used in modern western music. Chord Tools is for use when 
studying the fundamentals of music theory. The Chord Tools will
be used later in conjunction with LaTeX to create an educational
document analyzing the chords and the relationships between key
signatures.

	Lilypond is required to use these files: http://lilypond.org

	Documented Chord Tools is a fork of the Chord Tools project
and is intended to present the Chord Tools. Latex will be used to 
create the overall document, which will be designed to be serve as
a single chapter in a larger document.

	Because the Chord Tools on their own lend themselves to use
in multiple documents, are able to presented in multiple ways throughout
a single document, and can easily be paired with other study aids and tools,
Documented Chord Tools became a fork. This is to allow the base Chord
Tools repository to remain useful as a discreet, flexible codebase.
